// At a lemonade stand, each lemonade costs $5.Customers are standing in a queue to buy from you and order one at a time(in the order specified by bills).Each customer will only buy one lemonade and pay with either a $5, $10, or $20 bill.You must provide the correct change to each customer so that the net transaction is that the customer pays $5.
// Note that you do not have any change in hand at first.
// Given an integer array bills where bills[i] is the bill the ith customer pays, return true if you can provide every customer with the correct change, or false otherwise.
//   Example 1:
// Input: bills = [5, 5, 5, 10, 20]
// Output: true
// Explanation: 
// From the first 3 customers, we collect three $5 bills in order.
// From the fourth customer, we collect a $10 bill and give back a $5.
// From the fifth customer, we give a $10 bill and a $5 bill.
// Since all customers got correct change, we output true.
//   Example 2:
// Input: bills = [5, 5, 10, 10, 20]
// Output: false
// Explanation: 
// From the first two customers in order, we collect two $5 bills.
// For the next two customers in order, we collect a $10 bill and give back a $5 bill.
// For the last customer, we can not give the change of $15 back because we only have two $10 bills.
// Since not every customer received the correct change, the answer is false.
//   Constraints:
// 1 <= bills.length <= 105
// bills[i] is either 5, 10, or 20.

// âœ… SOLUTION
